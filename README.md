**# DeltaVision-Claw-Shield

<p>
  <h1> OVERVIEW </h1>
  <h3>
This project from DeltaVision for the "Claw&Shield" Hackathon is built using a structured layered approach. This ensures scalability, maintainability, and clean separation of responsibilities across different system components.
    <br>
The system processes user requests through a defined pipeline of validation, logic handling, execution, and data interaction — ensuring organized and efficient operation.

<h1>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h1>
  <br>
  <h3>
    This project is used to demonstrate the practical implementation of: <br>
     -> Layered System Architecture <br>
     -> Modular Backend Design <br>
     -> Structured Request Processing <br>
     -> Separation of concerns <br>
     -> Scalable System Engineering <br>
  <br>
    It simulates a real-world application where reqs are processed across independent yet interconnected modules.

    CURRENT CAPABILITIES
  </h1> <br>
  <h3>
    Currently, the system is capable of: <br>
      <b>==>Structured Request Handling</b> <br>
            -> Accepts input from the interface layer <br>
            -> Validates and preprocesses incoming data <br>
  <br>
      <b>==>Business Logic Processing</b> <br>
            -> Applies defined rules and workflows <br>
            -> Ensures correct transformation of inputs <br>
            -> Handles edge cases and conditional branching <br>
  <br>
      <b>==>Core Execution Processing</b> <br>
            -> Executes the primary computational or operational tasks <br>
            -> Converts validated logic into real system actions <br>
            -> Maintains optimized execution flow <br>
  <br>
      <b>==>Data Management</b> <br>
            -> Interacts with the database layer <br>
            -> Performs structured data storage and retrieval <br>
            -> Maintains data integrity and consistency <br>
  <br>
      <b>==>Error Handling</b> <br>
            -> Layer-wise exception handling <br>
            -> Controlled failure management <br>
            -> Clear response feedback system <br>

  <h1> ARCHITECTURE </h1> <br>
  <h3>
    The system follows a layered architectural model: <br>
    Presentation Layer <br>
            ↓  <br>
    Application / Logic Layer  <br>
            ↓  <br>
      Execution Layer  <br>
            ↓  <br>
        Data Layer <br>
