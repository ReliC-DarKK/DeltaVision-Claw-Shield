# DeltaVision-Claw-Shield

<p>
  <h1> OVERVIEW </h1>
  <h3>
This project from DeltaVision for the "Claw&Shield" Hackathon is built using a structured layered approac. This ensures scalability, maintainability, and clean separation of responsibilities acroos different system components.
    <br>
The system processes user requests through a defined pipeline of validation, logic handling, execution, and data interaction — ensuring organized and efficient operation.

<h1>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h1>
  <h3>
    This project is used to demonstrate the practical implementation of:
     -> Layered System Architecture
     -> Modular Backend Design
     -> Structured Request Processing
     -> Separation of concerns
     -> Scalable System Engineering
  <br>
    It simulates a real-world application where reqs are processed across independent yet interconnected modules.

    CURRENT CAPABILITIES
  </h1>
  <h3>
    Currently, the system is capable of:
      <b>==>Structured Request Handling</b>
            -> Accepts input from the interface layer
            -> Validates and preprocesses incoming data
  <br>
      <b>==>Business Logic Processing</b>
            -> Applies defined rules and workflows
            -> Ensures correct transformation of inputs
            -> Handles edge cases and conditional branching
  <br>
      <b>==>Core Execution Processing</b>
            -> Executes the primary computational or operational tasks
            -> Converts validated logic into real system actions
            -> Maintains optimized execution flow
  <br>
      <b>==>Data Management</b>
            -> Interacts with the database layer
            -> Performs structured data storage and retrieval
            -> Maintains data integrity and consistency
  <br>
      <b>==>Error Handling</b>
            -> Layer-wise exception handling
            -> Controlled failure management
            -> Clear response feedback system

  <h1> ARCHITECTURE </h1>
  <h3>
    The system follows a layered architectural model:
    Presentation Layer  
            ↓  
    Application / Logic Layer  
            ↓  
      Execution Layer  
            ↓  
        Data Layer
